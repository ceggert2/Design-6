## Introduction to me
Hello, I am **Connor Eggert** and I am pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering. 
I love reading so ima add my favorite quote here so I could use my new Markdown knowledge:
> If ice can burn, then love and hate can mate
> -(A Storm of Swords by George RR Martin)

I'll add more relevant information as I go along but this is my starting point lol
